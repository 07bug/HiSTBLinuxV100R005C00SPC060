note£º
1. the encoded data is dropped without being saved to the files.
2. the gpu should be open while compiling the whole sdk
3. if you want to copy this sample to the boad: 
	1) besides the sample image, the sample/res/ddr_test also need to be copyed the board; 
	2) check and change macros GPU_SOURCE_FILENAME_VS_ES20T4 GPU_SOURCE_FILENAME_VS_ES20T4_GLASS GPU_SOURCE_FILENAME_VS_ES20T4_BGRND GPU_SOURCE_FILENAME_VS_STPETERS in hi_gpu.c
	3) check and change macros PIC_FILENAME in hi_osd.c
4. 	ts_file1 and ts_file2 could be located on the flash, mounted u_disk or nfs files
