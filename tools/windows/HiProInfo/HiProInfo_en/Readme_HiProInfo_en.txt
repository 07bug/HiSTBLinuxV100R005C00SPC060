If the user operates the application in the wrong way, or the application gives no response after user clicking "Burn" button, please restart HiProInfo application and try again.
	
	2. "Enter" key may help you not use the mouse.
	
	3. In order to support CA boards, users must provide two files named "BurnConfig.ini" (with the IsCA parameter set to 1) and "ProgrammerforCA.bin". "ProgrammerforCA.bin" file is not needed when burning NON-CA boards, and if users provide "BurnConfig.ini" file, the IsCA parameter must be set to 0.
	
	4. In order to supprot miniboot boards, users must set the ProgrammerFileName parameter in "BurnConfig.ini" and provide the corresponding programmer.bin. Ordinary uboot needn't the programmer.bin file and must comment out the ProgrammerFileName parameter.
